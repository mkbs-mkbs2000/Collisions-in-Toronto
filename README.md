## What Is This About
This map visualises the total accident counts involving pedestrians and/or cyclists in Toronto, shown with hexgrids over the City of Toronto.

It also allows users to filter to show how accidents with major injuries and fatal accidents are spread across Toronto.

Users can key in their address in the Geocoder function, and the map will zoom in to the area, so that users can find out the hexagon and therefore how many accidents around their area.
